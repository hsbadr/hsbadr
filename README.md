Today, there are many skilled and talented research scientists working across industry and applying their abilities to solve problems of their field. It is rare, however, to find a data scientist who dynamically combines multiple disciplines (interdisciplinary research), innovative ideas and software approaches to solve complex real-world problems using (big) data analytics and numerical simulations. I am a data scientist with broad and in-depth skills and over 20 years of experience in statistical analysis, numerical modeling of physical processes, data visualization, and software development as well as project management and leadership. I am a software-independent developer as I can easily and quickly switch between different platforms and master newer solutions. I am trained first in aerospace engineering and earth sciences, and have developed my skills in programming, mathematics, statistics, and physics to address grand challenges in aerodynamics, hydroclimatology, and global health.
